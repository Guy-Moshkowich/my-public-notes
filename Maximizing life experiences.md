# Maximizing life experiences
Life is short and so you need to [maximize life experiences](./Die%20with%20zero.md). 
The type of experiences [depends on your age](./Not%20every%20option%20is%20open%20for%20you%20at%20any%20age.md). You spend less and less as you [get old](Go-Go,%20slow-Go%20and%20no-Go%20years.md). 
To enjoy life you need three things: health, money and time. when you are younger, you have health and time but lack money. when you are old, you have money, time but lack health. The golden years are 40's\-60's where you have all three.
Experiences are valuable also because they [yield dividends](./Experience%20yield%20dividends.md) in the form of memories.
