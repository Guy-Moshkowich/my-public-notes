# Die with zero
The goal of dying with zero is [[Maximizing life experiences|Maximizing life experiences]].
This is different from the common path of maximizing wealth. 
High quality experiences cost money and so you should pay for them using your savings when you saved enough. You should be aware of how you spend your time and savings to balance between the risk of having no money when too old and having fun when you are young and enjoy life more. Your age limits your [[Not every option is open for you at any age|possible experiences]]. 

Maximizing for wealth might actually limit your experiences as it take your time and might require saving.

Saving all your life for worst case scenario is like those who keep plastic covers protecting their expensive furniture - instead of enjoying them - they "keep them safe" so they will last longer but never get to enjoy them to the maximum. 

You need to set the date for stop saving and start spending your wealth while you can still enjoy it. Plan for that and have some guess of your [[When will you die?|life expectancy]]. There are financial tools to make sure you will not reach zero before you dies which cost much less than saving to the worst case scenario. Tools like [[Annuities and Reverse Mortgage |Annuities and Reverse Mortgage ]] and [[Buy long term care insurance instead of saving for the worst case|long-term care insurances]].
This date is not your retiring date. you can continue to work but you just start spending more than you earn. you can work less than full time job. you might be interested in activities not related to work. and even if not, you can spend more of your income to get more enjoyment from your profession: take master class, go to conference more often, fly in first class, travel to meet others who share your passion.

It is not simple to switch from saving mode to spending mode. It requires courage to break an old habit. Staying in autopilot mode is also kind of taking action and this is also risky. You need to differentiate between high risk and fear: fear tends to increase risk out of proportions. 

It does not mean you do not [[Give your money to your kids when it will be most useful for them|give your kids]] money or that you do not have enough saving for your old years. 

You should buy more time once you have enough money.
