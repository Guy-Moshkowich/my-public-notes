# Give your money to your kids when it will be most useful for them

You should aim to give them your money when it will be most useful for them. Money is useful in the age where you start a family and need it for housing and raising young kids. If you give your money after you die, most likely it will have less impact as your kids will already be old themselves. If you dies at age 85 then your kids will be at their 50's. Most people get their inheritance at age 60. At older age more money is useless. you might think that if you will save for longer time you will have more money to give. That is probably true but absolute amount is not the whole picture and timing is a significant factor. Giving less but when needed \- this is much better. This way you will see them enjoy it and enjoy their gratification and appreciation for your support. 

Giving away your money when you are still alive has liberating feeling \- yours money is yours. no hard feelings if you want to spend it \- it is not reduce from the kids inheritance. 

Giving your money after your are dead is not generosity. you are dead and your assets will be taken from you by law anyway. you have no choice. But, if you are a live when giving your money then it generosity.
