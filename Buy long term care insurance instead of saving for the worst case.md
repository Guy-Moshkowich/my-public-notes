# Buy long term care insurance instead of saving for the worst case

What about saving for health care during the last weeks of your life? The answer is to have a long term care insurance. It make more sense to invest in the quality of life when you are able to enjoy it than in your final period. Insurance will cost you less than saving for the worse case scenario. And even if they will not pay then let the chips fall where they may. 
Also consider that decay may come early and over quickly.
