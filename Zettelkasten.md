# Zettelkasten
A knowledge system that capture your knowledge and enable creative work based on your ideas. It is your repository for your [smart notes](./Smart%20notes%20(permanent%20note).md).  Zettelkasten in English means "slip\-box". New notes are connected to existing note. This generates sequences of notes over time. This sequences are a list of related ideas that can be transformed into new arguments and ideas. These are generated bottom\-up as each note is a standalone abstract idea that contributes to some higher order idea. This is in contrast to top\-bottom approach when you start by stating your idea and then looks for content to write about it. Use Zettelkasten as a  [tool](./Zettelkasten's%20creativity%20work%20flows.md) for doing creative work. It is THE basic tool to enable [The intellectual life](./The%20intellectual%20life.md)
