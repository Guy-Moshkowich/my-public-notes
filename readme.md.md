# My Public Obsidian Notes
This repository is a public slice of my [Zettelkasten](./Zettelkasten.md), mixing technical and personal thinking: 
you’ll find notes on mathematics, homomorphic encryption alongside productivity and life\-hacks summaries. 
It is a "digital garden" rather than a polished textbook: 
a place to capture ideas, insights, and heuristics that I find useful and want to share with the world.

# About me
I am a lifelong learner, interested in productivity, creativity, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy and art .
