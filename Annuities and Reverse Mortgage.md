# Annuities and Reverse Mortgage
you can buy "income annuities" insurance - this means you give the insurance company a large sum of money and they promise to give you a fix predeterminate sum of money each month until you die. your heirs will not get the initial sum you paid incase you die before you receive back all your initial sum. instead some other person who live longer than his some will get it. The alternative of you saving for your last chapter and this can be a large sum that you might not get to enjoy at the end of your life and so a waste of money.

Reverse Mortgage is another financial tool where you get a large loan for mortgaging your house to a bank and have your heirs pay it or get part of your house.
