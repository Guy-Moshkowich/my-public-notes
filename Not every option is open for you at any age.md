# Not every option is open for you at any age

You need to be aware that in every age there is a set of opportunities that are open and they will change overtime. If time pass and you did not do certain things - you will not have option to do them later in life. People do not realize this until it is too late. The transition between periods is usually vague and can be detected after it is complete.
In general, the possible experiences are diminished as you get older. at the extreme, when you have serious health condition you have none. you have only your memories of past experiences to enjoy.

For example, backpacking trip in Europe can be done in your 20's but it is much less fun in your 30's as you will be the oldest guy in the room and you fill less comfortable to sleep with other 6 young man in a hostel room, you will connect less to them due to age difference. Reading bed time stories to your kids is possible until their reach a certain age and then you can't do it anymore. you can go skiing in your 20's-40's but later it is harder. you probably can't run a marathon in your 80's. Some activities can be done in almost any age e.g., go to a cruise, read books, play chess, watch classic movies.
